# labyrinth generator

## Instruction 
    Go to the App page in this link: https://bimsc21-perlin-maze.herokuapp.com/examples/perlin-noise/
    The Output is the Geometry of the labyrinth, which can be downloaded

## function of the app 

    This game allows the user to generate a verity of labyrinths and 
    explore the shortest distance it would take to reach the end point.  
    The users can compare the   distances and  see their changes to the parent shape 
    can effect the labyrinth. If they wish to further explore they can  even download
    the generated  geometry. 

## Features of the app
    Geometry of the labyrinth can be controlled through parameters which are as follows 
### Radius 
        the radius of the parent shape(sphere) that affects the surface on
         which the maze is mapped.  Radius ranged between 20 and 70
### U-count
        u-count represents the number of divisions of the mesh on its x axis. 
        U count range is between 1 and 30 
### V-count
        V-count represents the number of divisions of the mesh on its y axis.
        V count range is between 1 and 30
### Time 
        Perlin noise as described by Ken Perlin is used to   distort the sphere. 
        Time ranged between 0 and 10. 
### Scale 
        Perlin noise as described by Ken Perlin is used to   distort the sphere.
         scale ranged between 0 and 10 which translate to 0   and 0.06.
### Seed 
        controls the randomness within the algorithm effects how the maze is generated.
         Seed ranges between 0 and 100.
### Start 
        this is the starting point that is used to connect with the end 
        point on the maze through the shortest path as expressed in the app.
         Points ranges from 0 and 3000 but also depends on u and v counts for 
         total number of points present in the parent shape. 
### Tube 
        thickness of the shortest path as selected via the start point and a fixed  end point.
         Tube thickness ranges from 0 to 10. 

### Length 
        This variable provides two outputs generated from your choices 
        which are the total length of all the paths within the labyrinth  
         and the distance of the path you have picked via the start point variable.  

### download 
        This output allows the user to download the chosen geometry in a 3dm format 



## contents of repo
    •	here is the repo   that contains  files needed to run  the   
    labyrinth generator  as a web server 
    •	files that have been added  and are useful for the generator
      are in src\examples\perlin-noise and \src\files


## Location of the generator within the repo

    Perlin-noise  folder contains 
        1.	the html code 
        2.	css code 
        3.	js code 
        4.	perlin_maze.gh ( found in src\files)

    •	these are important to maintain and functioning of web app.
    •	html handles the  web interface css handles the aesthetics and js  
    makes sure  grasshopper files  can connect with  aws  rhino compute server 
    and Heroku  and  .gh  hands the  algorithm that generates the geometry
